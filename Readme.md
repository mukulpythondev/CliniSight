# CliniSight

## Solution Overview
CliniSight AI is an intelligent clinical co-pilot that helps doctors make faster, better decisions. It automatically reads real-time patient data in the FHIR format and uses powerful GPT AI to interpret it instantly. The system highlights chronic conditions, flags urgent alerts, and suggests next steps—all in an easy-to-use interface built with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend. This allows doctors to spend less time searching through complex records and more time focusing on patient care, leading to quicker diagnoses, fewer errors, and improved outcomes.

**CliniSight Data Processing Flow:**
- FHIR API → Backend Ingestion → LLM Reasoning Engine → Rule Engine → Clinical Dashboard → Alerts & Suggestions

---

## Problem Statement
**Challenges in Healthcare Data Management:**
- **Information Overload:** Lack of data filtering, excessive data volume
- **Cognitive Load:** Burnout risks, high mental strain
- **FHIR Navigation Issues:** Slow data retrieval, error-prone processes

**Patient Visit to Decision Process:**
- Patient Visit → Access EHR → Sift FHIR Records → Manual Risk Assessment → Delayed Decision

---

## Flowchart: Streamlined Patient Care Workflow
1. **User Logs In:** Secure access to system
2. **Patient Search:** Locate patient records
3. **FHIR Data Fetch:** Retrieve patient data
4. **Copilot Analysis (LLM + Rules):** Analyze data for insights
5. **Dashboard:** View critical patient information (risks, meds, alerts)
6. **Suggested Labs / Next Steps:** Plan future actions
7. **Optionally Generate Prescription:** Create prescriptions if needed

---

## Feasibility, Uniqueness & Impact
**Feasibility:**
- Fully working Dockerized prototype
- Open-source FHIR and LLMs enable quick customization
- Deployed with real-time clinical insight engine
- Scalable microservice architecture

**Uniqueness:**
- **LLM + Rules Fusion:** Hybrid reasoning (LLM + hard rules)
- **FHIR-Native:** Built natively on FHIR standards
- **Copilot for Clinicians:** Real-time suggestions, not just summaries
- **Context Awareness:** Tracks history across encounters and flags patterns

**Impact:**
- Saves clinicians 2–3 hours/week
- Reduces risk of missed diagnoses
- Improves decision speed & safety
- Potential deployment in ERs, OPDs, remote care setups

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB instance (local or cloud)

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mukulpythondev/CliniSight
cd CliniSight
```

### 2. Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend/node
npm install
# Configure your MongoDB URI and Twilio credentials in config/database.js or via environment variables
npm start
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd ../../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend will typically run on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) and the backend on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default.

## Usage
1. **Register/Login** as a doctor or patient (OTP will be sent via SMS).
2. **Doctors** can view, search, and analyze patient records from their dashboard.
3. **Patients** can access their own records securely.
4. **Analyze** feature (WIP): Upload and analyze patient data for insights.
